# Bracelets

This demo was inspired by WWDC '24 talk *'Enhance your UI Animations and Transitions'*. 
There is no sample app to go with the talk, so the code here is my own. 
Beads are laid out along a cubic bezier path so that they are equally spaced and rotated 
according to the gradient of the path at the point where each bead is located. 
There is no animation code yet because the APIs discussed in the talk are all in beta. When they ship, I'll update the demo.
